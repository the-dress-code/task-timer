general overview of making app:
- data you want
- functions
- ui

think about why the world will be better when ur done with this project:

abstract - be kind to future you with abstract ideas rather than concrete ones
why?
why would my user care?
why is your app better than a whiteboard?

- allowing a simpler process of determining your goals and making time for them
- gives user a clear view of what they want and when theyâ€™ll accomplish their goals.
- someone (who uses macOS, is familiar with entering data by keyboard and can use clojure functions) gets more done by deciding on what tasks they want to get done and how long they want to spend on each. 
- someone (who uses macOS, is familiar with entering data by keyboard and can use clojure functions) can organize their time with tasks set to timers at customizable intervals.
    - can choose how many task timers to set and for how long. 
    - at the end of each task timer, alarm will sound & the next task timer will start display task name. 
    - task timers are pause-able & resume-able - flexible for your unpredictable life.
    - can choose to display a progress report at end of a session. 
    - can save, load, and duplicate / edit a session so you can repeat your success another time or tweak it to better suit you. 
- when one task is done, you are prompted with the next task automatically so you can switch gears and focus on the next thing, without having to think about it too much.

ABSTRACT:
- helps you plan how to spend time ahead of time. 
- keep track of what you want to do & for how long you want to do it for.
- make a session of timed tasks that alert you for the next one until the session is over.
- frees you up to focus on task at hand, rather than watching a clock and remembering the next task.

FEATURES:
- build a session of one or more customizable interval timers
- things you can customize about the timers:
    - name of timer
    - length of timer, even if session already started
    - appearance of timer
    - alert sound and volume, even if session already started
- features of the timers:
    - pause
    - start
    - ** when timer ends, alert goes off for next task and next task begins once alert is acknowledged.** 
- things you can do with session:
    - name the session
    - save the session
    - load the session
    - duplicate the session
    - edit the session
    - display a progress report at end of a session (or when paused?)
